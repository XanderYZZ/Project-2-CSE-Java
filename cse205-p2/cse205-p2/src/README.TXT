This folder contains some of the Java source code files for the project:

Main.java
---------
Finish the code in this class by studying the UML class diagram and reading the comments and
implementing the pseudocode.

Sorter.java
-----------
This class is completed for you. Study it to see how it works.

Student.java
------------
Some of the code is completed for you but you must complete parts of it. Study the UML class
diagram to help you understand what to write in this class. Although this looks like a large class,
most of the methods which need to be implemented are simple accessor/mutator methods.

TuitionConstants.java
---------------------
This class contains various constants related to calculating tuition. See ยง3 of the project
document for a discussion of some of the constants.

These project files are omitted and you must implement them from scratch using the UML class diagram
and the project description as guides:

OnCampusStudent.java
OnlineStudent.java

I hope you enjoy this project. Good luck!
