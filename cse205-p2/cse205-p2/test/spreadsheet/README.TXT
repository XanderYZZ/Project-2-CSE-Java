You can use this Libre Calc spreadsheet (will open in Microsoft Excel) to calculate the tuition
for a student given the various student parameters discussed in the project document.

I expect you to create your own test cases for testing your program, so when creating a test case,
you can enter the information that you made up for a student in the spreadsheet and it will perform
the calculations for you to determine what the correct output from your program should be.
